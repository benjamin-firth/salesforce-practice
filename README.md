# Salesforce Project

For this assignment I created a Lightning Web Component for a contact list in Salesforce.  This included:
- [x] a table (sortable based on title) populated with contacts from a SOQL query
- [x] cached queried results
- [x] a form to add new contacts including First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email and Title fields
- [x] alerts for successfully added contacts, missing required fields, and duplicate contacts
- [x] a dynamically updated list once the contact is uploaded
