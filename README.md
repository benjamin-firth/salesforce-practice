# Salesforce Practice

## This repo contains the current working code for a take-home interview challenge I was given.

For this assignment, I had to create a Lightning Web Component for a contact list.  This component had the list table (filterable based on title), as well as a spot to add new contacts to the list.  Alerts were shown for successful added contacts, missing required fields, and duplicate contacts.  Once added, the contact then shows up on the list.
